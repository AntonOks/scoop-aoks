This is my personal [SCOOP](https://scoop.sh) bucket repo, forked of [Ash258's Generic scoop bucket](https://github.com/Ash258/GenericBucket) template.

Feel free to copy any manifest json file into your own bucket _OR_ clone the repo and make it your own one (or send pulls ;) ) _OR_ just add it to your SCOOP setup with i.e.

```scoop bucket add scoop-aoks https://github.com/AntonOks/scoop-aoks.git```.
